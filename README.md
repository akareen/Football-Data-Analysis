An in-depth analysis of Football data for all major leagues. The aim is for this repository to contain comprehensive data, tools and code for exploring and analysing Football match and player statistics, as well as historical odds data.  

This project is currently under development, to see a repository that this is being based on, please see my repostitory [AFL-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/akareen/AFL-Data-Analysis).

I am currently making progress on the scraping and cleaning of the data, there is a variety of sources that are detailed in some areas whilst lacking in others so I am working on making the data as consistent as possible.
